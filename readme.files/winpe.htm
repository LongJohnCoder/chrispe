<h2><u>Windows Preinstallation Environment</u></h2>

<p>
Windows Preinstallation Environment (<font class="file">WinPE</font>) is a lightweight version of Windows that can be used for many tasks. It was originally designed as a 32-bit replacement for DOS - for windows deployment, backup and recovery. <font class="file">WinPE</font> is a complete, standalone operating system and will work independently of any other operating systems already installed. See <a class="external" target="_blank" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc766093(v=ws.10).aspx">here</a> for more information. 
</p>



<p>
When a computer is running (booted from) a full version of Windows certain files are 'locked' - making it difficult to take a system backup or to remove a virus/malware. Consequently some tasks are best performed when the operating system is offline - this can be achieved by booting to another operating system such as <font class="file">WinPE</font> to access the offline system. 
</p>




<p>
There are two distinct methods for booting <font class="file">WinPE</font> - RAM Boot and Flat Boot. RAM Boot is the most common method and anyone who has installed Windows Vista/7/8/8.1 will already (perhaps unknowingly) have used it. Microsoft recommend a minimum of 512 MB RAM in order to run a RAM booted version of <font class="file">WinPE</font> - in my own tests it was possible to boot some versions of <font class="file">WinPE</font> with 256 MB RAM. For more details about RAM and Flat boot <font class="file">WinPE</font> and RAM requirements, please see <a class="external" target="_blank" href="http://mistyprojects.co.uk/documents/WinPE.RAM/winpe.ram.usage.htm">here</a>.
</p>



<p>
When <font class="file">WinPE</font> is RAM Booted or Flat Booted from read only media it will not save any changes made to it when the system is rebooted. A benefit of this is always having a clean (virus free) <font class="file">WinPE</font> operating system on boot. 
</p>




<p>
<font class="file">WinPE</font> is easy to customise. The builds prior to customisation are very limited and the UI (User Interface) is command line. It is possible to adapt these builds to use a GUI shell and other programs and utilities can be added so that various tasks can be carried out, including but not limited to - 
<ul>
<li><font class="file">Disk partitioning</font></li>
<li><font class="file">Deploying Windows</font></li>
<li><font class="file">Disk/partition imaging</font></li>
<li><font class="file">Data backup</font></li>
<li><font class="file">System/data recovery</font></li>
<li><font class="file">System restore</font></li>
<li><font class="file">Forensic analysis</font></li>
<li><font class="file">Password reset</font></li>
<li><font class="file">Offline Virus Scan</font></li>
</ul>
</p>



<h2><u>WinPE Versions</u></h2>


<p>
There are a number of different versions of official Microsoft <font class="file">WinPE</font>. I believe that the earlier versions used the same codebase as Windows XP/2003 - these are usually referred to as <font class="file">WinPE</font> 1.*.
</p>



<p>
Earlier versions of <font class="file">WinPE</font> (prior to the introduction of version 2.0) were aimed at enterprise customers and were not available to the general public. As of version 2.0 it was possible for non-enterprise customers to create their own <font class="file">WinPE</font> by using the freely available Windows Automated Installation Kit (WAIK). The WAIK has now been replaced with the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK). 
</p>



<p>
Windows Operating Systems use a numbering format for identification purposes - these numbers can be used to identify the codebase from which a particular <font class="file">WinPE</font> was created. Windows builds use the numbering format ‘MajorVersion.MinorVersion.Build’ - e.g. 6.1.7600. Unlike the product names associated with Windows Operating Systems (e.g. Windows 7) these numbers can refer to multiple products - version 6.1.7600 for example refers to both Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008.
</p>


<p>
<font class="file">WinPE</font> versions include -

<ul>
<li><b>2.0</b> (6.0.6000) - Windows Vista</li>
<li><b>2.1</b> (6.0.6001) - Windows Vista (SP1)/ Server 2008</li>
<li><b>3.0</b> (6.1.7600) - Windows 7/Server 2008 R2</li>
<li><b>3.1</b> (6.1.7601) - Windows 7 (SP1)/Server 2008 R2 (SP1)</li>
<li><b>4.0</b> (6.2.9200) - Windows 8/Windows Server 2012</li>
<li><b>5.0</b> (6.3.9600) - Windows 8.1</li>
<li><b>5.1</b> (6.3.9600) - Windows 8.1 Update 1</li>
<li><b>10.x</b> (10.0.#####) - Windows 10</li>
</ul>
</p>


<p>
There are 32 bit and 64 bit versions of all of the above <font class="file">WinPE</font> systems. To install a Windows 32 bit operating system you will need to use a 32 bit <font class="file">WinPE</font>, and to install a Windows 64 bit operating system you will need to use a Windows 64 bit <font class="file">WinPE</font> - I am referring here to running setup.exe included with the operating system media.
</p>

<p>
More recent versions of <font class="file">WinPE</font> are likely to better support more recent hardware without the need for injecting drivers. <font class="file">WinPE</font> 3.x builds are very stable and I would personal recommend using these builds unless a Windows Forensic Environment is required - or hardware is not supported.
