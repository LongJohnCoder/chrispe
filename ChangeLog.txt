		=========


20190506 (6th May 2019)
========

* Moved Tweaks.script to Core so that it is processed before WoW64.
  This significantly reduces build time if WoW64 is selected in the
  build (15 seconds saved on a relatively fast test system with a 
  Crucial BX300 Solid State Drive).

* Included option to set RAMDISK size as 1024 MB. 

* Added support for Windows 10 builds 1803 and 1809.

========

  updated to support the new build.

* Compatibility setting for ChrisPE edited to include 
	- "FileRenameCanMoveDir=True"

* Updates to all Applications scripts to add a check to ensure that
  the correct image in boot.wim is updated if Applications are added
  post build to boot.wim.

20180321 (21st March 2018)
========

Following scripts added - 

* Settings > Network - new script. This has been split from the Settings 
  > Recommended script. Includes option to set the ComputerName. 
  Enabling any of the options in this script will add Unattend.xml 
  to the root of the \ChrisPE.Files\ISO.ROOT\ folder and will add an 
  entry to run wpeinit.exe from winpeshl.ini. The unattend.xml file 
  includes an entry for setting the default screen resolution to 1024x768. 
  This will probably not make any difference if using Windows 8 or newer 
  sources, but should if Windows 6.1.7600/6.1.7601 source files are used 
  as these sources default to low screen resolutions.

* Applications > TightVNC Server script added. This includes an option 
  for automatically starting TightVNC Server during the WinPE boot 
  process (automatically initializing the network).

* Finalise > Subst - new script. Use to run subst to assign a virtual 
  mount point for the media used to boot ChrisPE.

* Finalise > WinFE - new script. Create a Windows Forensic Environment.

* Drivers > Drivers - new script. Experimental Driver integration support. 
  Get WAIK Tools is used to download DISM - ensure that your firewall 
  is configured to allow access to GWT.exe.

Other (main) changes -

* Main project script now includes an option to select the METHOD - either 
  INJECT or EXTRACT. using the EXTRACT method will significantly increase 
  build time as the contents of boot.wim will be fully extracted before
  the project run. 

* Get WAIK Tools added to Tools. Used to download DISM and dependencies.
  This is required for the new Drivers script. 

* nircmd added to tools. 

* innounp.exe added to tools. 

* Settings > Recommended - Network option removed from this script and 
  moved to a seperate script (see above).

* All Applications scripts can now be executed post build by using the 
  Run Script button.

* A new method of generating shortcuts for any programs with 'Include 
  Program in boot.wim' disabled has been introduced. Shortcuts will 
  now be added to the main shell menu after running FindPrograms menu 
  option from the booted WinPE - this works by searching for a unique 
  tag file and then running a series of batch files if the .tag file 
  is located. The tag filename is generated based on date and time. 
  Shortcuts for programs on the .iso will be added to the following
  menu option -
	Start > ExternalMedia



20180311 (11th March 2018)
========

* Licence files added. 

* Updated Tweaks.script to add segoeui.ttf font to the  build - fixing 
  an issue in Windows 10 based WinPE where italic fonts are displayed 
  for icons and in other areas.



20180306 (6th March 2018)
========

* Original release - including PEBakery 0.9.3 beta3.
